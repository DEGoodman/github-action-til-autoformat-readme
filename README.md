# TIL
> Today I Learned

A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and he was
apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection].

_4 TILs and counting..._
